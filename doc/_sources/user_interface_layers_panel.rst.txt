Layers panel
------------

The Layers panel shows a tree view of all layers that have been created for the current
painting project.

Each layer has Albedo, Metallic, Roughness, Emission and Depth information. The painted
material is a combination of all layers, applied from bottom to top.

This panel has a tool bar that can be used to create, duplicate, delete, reorder and
configure layers. Configuring a layer consists in defining a transparency level for each
component of the layer.

Layers can also be dragged and dropped in the tree view, and can also be hidden.
