Library panel
-------------

The library panel shows all nodes defined in both base and user libraries in a tree
view. The base library is provided with Material Maker and the nodes it contains are
documented in this manual. The user library contains all nodes that were added using
the **Tools -> Add selected node to user library** menu item.

The filter field above the library tree can be used to quickly find a specific node.
The tree will be updated whenever the filter string is modified. It is possible to
give focus to the search field using the **Control+F** keyboard shortcut.
